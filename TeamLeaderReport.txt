##Summary

Our team met a few times to distribute work as well as brainstorm
together. Each person communicated with each other so that everyone
had help when they needed it. Anthony Queen worked on the project 
and select functions. Cuza Onyeagba implemented the union function.
Kaitlin McFarland worked on the minus and typecheck functions. 
Houston Bass developed the join functions. We made deadlines 
throughout our development process that we all worked together to 
complete.
